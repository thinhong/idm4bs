## Interventions that can be modelled [@jit2011]

-   Vaccination
-   Screening
-   Social distancing
-   Post-exposure treatment

# Vaccination

## Model vaccination

To model vaccination, we need to decide 2 things:

1.  What is the vaccine effect? Does it protect against infection, severe disease, transmission, or a combination?

2.  How do we model imperfect protection?

# Vaccine effect

## Prevent infection

Vaccine prevents the pathogen from establishing an infection in the body. A vaccinated person is less likely to get infected.

![](img/vax/prv-inf.svg)

## Prevent infection

Assuming a perfect vaccine against infection, the model can be designed as follows:

![](img/vax/prv-inf-mod.svg)

Vaccinated people $V$ remain uninfected in their lifetime and do not participate in disease transmission.

## Prevent infection

You can simplify this model by moving susceptible people to the $R$ compartment because they also do not participate in disease transmission.

![](img/vax/prv-inf-mod-2.svg)

## Prevent severe disease

A vaccinated individual still get infected but experiences a much milder form of the disease.

![](img/vax/prv-dis.svg)

## Prevent severe disease

Assuming a perfect vaccine against severe disease, the model can be designed as follows:

![](img/vax/prv-dis-mod.svg)

## Prevent transmission

A vaccinated person still get infected, still get sick, but they are less likely to spread the disease to others.

![](img/vax/prv-trans.svg)

## Prevent transmission

Assuming a perfect vaccine against transmission, the model can be designed as follows:

![](img/vax/prv-trans-mod.svg)

$I$ being the only source of infection that contributes to the force of infection. Vaccinated people $S_v$ still get infected and become $I_v$, but they do not transmit the disease.

# Imperfect protections

What is meant by a vaccine with effectiveness of 80%?

## All-or-nothing model

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
**All-or-nothing** (AoN, also called the **polarized** [@park2023], or **take**) model assumes that **among vaccinated** individuals, a **proportion** $VE_P$ are **completely protected**, while **the remaining fraction** $1 - VE_P$ remains **completely unprotected** [@zachreson2023; @park2023].
:::

An effectiveness of 80% here implies that among vaccinated people, 80% are completely protected, and 20% receive no protection [@worldhealthorganization2013].

## All-or-nothing model

![All-or-nothing vaccination model [@park2023]](img/vax/aon-mod.svg){#fig-aon-mod}

## Leaky model

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
**Leaky** (or **degree**) model assumes that **all vaccinated** individuals **are partially protected** [@zachreson2023].
:::

An effectiveness of 80% here implies that all vaccinated people have the endpoint of interest reduced by 80% compared to non-vaccinees.

![](img/vax/leaky.svg)

## Leaky model

The assumption that no vaccinated people is totally or permanently protected implies one or both of the following [@worldhealthorganization2013]:

-   No amount (titre) of the immune marker is totally protective or, if it is, no individual can maintain that titre for a long period (because of waning or transient immunosuppression)
-   The degree of protection is a function of the level of the immune marker - the simplest explanation being that protection is a function of both the level of the immune marker and the challenge dose.

## Leaky model

![Leaky vaccination model [@park2023]](img/vax/leaky-mod.svg){#fig-leaky-mod}

## Mixed effects

Imperfect vaccines often have a combination of effects: they can protect against infection, severe disease, and transmission at the same time.

![](img/vax/prv-mix.svg)

## Mixed effects

Assuming a vaccine with leaky effectiveness $VE_L$ against infection and severe disease, the model can be designed as follows:

![](img/vax/prv-inf-dis-mod.svg)

## Multiple doses

Some vaccines require multiple doses. Below is the DynaMICE model [@verguet2015] for the 2-dose measles vaccine, assuming AoN effectiveness for both doses.

![](img/vax/dynamice.svg)

## Other interventions

-   Screening
-   Social distancing
-   Post-exposure treatment

1.  What is the ~~vaccine~~ intervention effect? Does it protect against infection, severe disease, transmission, or a combination?

2.  How do we model imperfect protection?

# Health economics

## Health economics

Health economics focuses on how to **allocate** healthcare **resources efficiently** to **maximize health outcomes** with limited resources [@goeree2013].

Health economics is used to support **decision-making** in situations where we must choose between different options. For example, given the current budget, should we buy HPV vaccines or COVID-19 vaccines?

## Types of analyses

**Partial** economic evaluations: studies that either **only** examine **cost or consequences**, or examine both costs and consequences but for only one intervention (**without a comparator**). This analysis **cannot** guide decision-making [@turner2021].

**Full** economic evaluations: compare **both** the **costs and consequences** of the intervention to a **comparator**.

## Types of analyses

### Full economic evaluations

There are 3 most popular types of full economic evaluations, the key difference lies in how they express the **consequences** [@turner2021]:

| Type               | Costs | Consequences                                                             |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| Cost-effectiveness | \$    | A single natural unit (life-years gained, cases averted, cases detected) |
| Cost-utility       | \$    | QALYs, DALYs                                                             |
| Cost-benefit       | \$    | \$                                                                       |

# Models in health economics

## Proportionate outcomes model

Also known as **decision tree** although exact definitions differ. Group flows divided into proportional outcomes over a single time period [@handbook2023].

All decision trees have 3 key components [@handbook2023]:

-   **Decision nodes**: where different comparators are compared.
-   **Chance nodes**: where potential outcomes are weighted by their probabilities.
-   **Terminal nodes**: endpoints of pathways, where costs and effectiveness calculated.

## Proportionate outcomes model

![Decision tree, adapted from [@handbook2023]](img/he/he-dtree.svg){#fig-he-dtree}

## Proportionate outcomes model

We have to specify a **fixed time horizon** represents the period over which probabilities and outcomes are considered [@kuntz2013]. If a decision tree uses a 50-year time horizon, the probabilities of outcomes are based on what could occur within those 50 years.

## Markov model

A Markov model is a **repeated** decision tree [@heeg2008]. The core elements of a Markov model are **health states** and **transition** [@handbook2023]:

-   **Health states** represent different conditions such as being healthy, sick, disease stages, or vaccinated. States must be mutually exclusive (a person can't be in two states at once) and exhaustive (cover all relevant conditions).

-   **Transition** is the probability (ranges between 0 and 1) of moving from one state to another.

## Markov model

Markov models are used for problems that involve risk over time, or when the timing of events is important [@kuntz2013]. We can use a Markov model to represent the endpoints shown in the decision tree @fig-he-dtree.

## Markov model

![Markov model, adapted from [@handbook2023]](img/he/he-markov.svg){#fig-he-markov}

## Markov model

|                     | **S** | **V** | **I**    | **R** | **D** | **Check** |
|---------------------|:------|:------|:---------|:------|:------|:----------|
| **Susceptible (S)** | 0.198 | 0.100 | 0.700    | 0.000 | 0.002 | 1.000     |
| **Vaccinated (V)**  | 0.000 | 0.998 | 0.000045 | 0.000 | 0.002 | 1.000     |
| **Infected (I)**    | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.129    | 0.865 | 0.006 | 1.000     |
| **Recovered (R)**   | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000    | 0.998 | 0.002 | 1.000     |
| **Deaths (D)**      | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.000    | 0.000 | 1.000 | 1.000     |

## Markov model

The key disadvantage of a Markov model is its **memoryless property** or **Markov assumption**, which assumes that transitions between health states depend only on the current state, not on the past history or duration spent in a state [@handbook2023].

## Compartmental dynamic model

Static models (decision tree, Markov model) assumes that the force of infection is constant or changes only as a function of age and other individual characteristics.

Dynamic model assumes that the **force of infection** can **vary** throughout the course of **time** and as a function of population **interactions**. Dynamic models are preferable for modeling the impact of a vaccine when considerations of herd immunity [@handbook2023].

## Compartmental dynamic model

We can adjust the Markov model @fig-he-markov to become a compartmental dynamic model by specifying that the force of infection varies over time.

![Compartmental dynamic model, adapted from [@handbook2023]](img/he/he-comp.svg){#fig-he-comp}

## Individual-based model

Individual-based model, also called **microsimulation** model, keeps track of each individual's behaviour [@kim2008]. This is done by repeatedly sampling from probability distributions a large number of times to understand the average and spread of potential results. The disadvantage is that they are time-consuming, as they require sometimes the simulation of millions of individuals to obtain stable estimates [@handbook2023].

## Individual-based model

### Choice of model

The most difficult decision in model building is "How complex should the model be?" [@hilborn1997]. Most modellers agree on 2 basic rules for choosing a model:

1.  Let the data tell you [@hilborn1997].

![Asst Prof. Kiesha Prem's lecture at MIDSEA Summer School 2024.](img/he/he-mod-choice.svg)

Simpler models need less data to estimate parameters but might overlook important system components. In contrast, complex models can capture more details but we may not have sufficient data to determine the parameters [@hilborn1997].

2.  The use of the model [@hilborn1997].

![Adapted from Asst Prof. Kiesha Prem's lecture at MIDSEA Summer School 2024.](img/he/he-mod.svg)

Simple models are useful if their assumptions are reasonable. For accurate predictions, a "wrong" but simpler model can do better than the "right" but complex model when parameters are estimated [@hilborn1997]. However, a complex model provides a better representation of uncertainty [@hilborn1997].

Given the close connection between health economics and policy, guidelines are available for every step of the process. Be sure to read and follow these guidelines when conducting your analysis. Below is guidance on choosing between static and dynamic models.

![How the choice of a static model, static model with approximation for herd immunity or dynamic model could be made [@jit2011]](img/he/he-mod-choice-guideline.svg)

# Measuring consequences

## Utility

Utility of health states are expressed on a scale from 0 to 1, where 0 represents the utility of being "dead" and 1 represents the utility of "perfect health" [@prieto2003].

## QALY

The quality-adjusted life year (QALY) measure "years lived in perfect health". One year in perfect health equals 1 QALY (1 Year $\times$ 1 Utility = 1 QALY). A year lived in less than perfect health is worth less than 1 QALY [@prieto2003].

$$\text{QALY} = \sum_{i = 0}^{\text{lifetime}} \text{Year} \times \text{Utility}$$

For example, 0.5 years in perfect health equals 0.5 QALYs (0.5 years $\times$ 1 Utility), the same as 1 year with a utility of 0.5 (1 year $\times$ 0.5 Utility) [@prieto2003]. The area under the curve equates to the total QALY value [@whitehead2010].

# Measuring costs

## Perspectives

![Overview of the perspectives included costs [@sittimart2024].](img/he/cost-perspective.png)

## Discounting vs inflation

Discounting is needed if a longer time horizon than 1-2 years is being considered. For most health economic evaluations, guidelines recommend a discount rate of 3% (high-income countries) to 5% (low- and middle-income countries) [@handbook2023].

Discounting is adjusting future costs and outcomes of health-care interventions to "present value" [@severens2004]. Discounting is based on the concept of "positive time preference", meaning that people prefers to benefit sooner rather than later [@severens2004].

## Discounting vs inflation

Imagine you can choose between getting (A) \$1000 today or (B) \$1000 in 5 years. Most people prefer option A because having \$1000 today allows you to use it immediately or invest it. The value of \$1000 today is greater than \$1000 in 5 years due to the opportunity to earn interest or invest it.

## Discounting vs inflation

$$\text{Present value} = \frac{\text{Future value}}{(1 + \text{annual discount rate})^\text{n years}}$$

Now imagine you can choose between getting \$500 today or \$1000 in 10 years. To make a fair comparison, you need to adjust the future value to present value. Let's say the discount rate is 5%. How much does \$1000 in 10 years worth today?

$$\text{Present value} = \frac{1000}{(1 + 0.05)^{10}} \approx 613.91$$

So \$1000 in 10 years is worth about \$614 in today's dollars.

## Discounting vs inflation

Discounting should not be confused with adjusting for inflation. **Both are needed**. Discounting reflects the loss in value when there is a delay in obtaining an item of value (e.g., adjusting for future value). The inflation adjustment reflects the change in purchasing power of currency (e.g., adjusting past costs to current values).

## Discounting vs inflation

-   Discounting: This is about the idea that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future. It reflects our preference for receiving benefits or money sooner rather than later. It’s used to adjust future costs or benefits to their present value.

-   Inflation: This is about how the general price level of goods and services increases over time. Inflation means that money loses its purchasing power, so what \$1 buys today might cost more in the future.
